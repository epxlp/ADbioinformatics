AD Bioinformatics tutorial

In this session we will use some online tools to investigate possible functional mechanisms of AD GWAS loci


GWAS association results

1. Download the file .................txt from this github repository to your computer

2. First open the file in excel and take a look at the results included. Sort the file to find the strongest association.

Q. What is the rsid of the lead SNP?



GTEx - eQTL analysis

3. Go to the GTEx website www.gtexprotal.org and enter the lead SNP rsid into the 'single-tissue eQTLs' search.

Q. Which gene is the lead SNP associated with the expression of?
Q. In which tissues is this observation seen?
Q. Is the AD-risk allele associated with increased or decreased expression?

4. Go back to the home page and enter the gene name into the 'transcriptome' search.

Q. Is the gene specifically or ubiquitously expressed?




Haploreg

4. Go to the Haploreg website https://pubs.broadinstitute.org/mammals/haploreg/haploreg.php and enter the lead SNP rsid.
